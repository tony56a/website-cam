===========

Just messing around with the .NET micro framework. Combines a UART camera with a basic HTTP server to create some kind
of remote image capturing thingy.Runs on the [FEZ Panda II](http://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=FEZ_Panda_II), and uses [the Linksprite camera interface library](http://www.tinyclr.com/codeshare/entry/165)

TODO
====

Fix bugs related to concurrent file access
Add some kind of time-lapse mode, and upload images to dropbox
